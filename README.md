# ðŸ¦  Viral Genomics with Biopython: Dengue Case Study

This project uses [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) to create a reproducible pipeline for exploring viral genomes, running BLAST queries, performing multiple sequence alignment, and building phylogenetic trees â€” demonstrated on **Dengue virus** sequences.
The viral genome analysis is done using public databases and bioinformatics tools, designed to be understandable to be users with no background in Biology.
